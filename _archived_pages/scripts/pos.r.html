excerpt: "
        This is a point of sale system (sales checkout, receipt printer, and data
        storage system) written using RebGUI.  It may help provide some basic
        insight into the workings of RebGUI.  Actually, the majority of this code
        manages user workflow - saving/retrieving receipts.  The RebGUI parts are
        simple and short.

        Note that the username and password info in the posp.db file should be
        created and read using a separate method, and encrypted.  The example
        posp.db file is created here as a demonstration.  Note also that the first
        field in the layout is designed to accept input from a keyboard wedge bar
        code scanner, with data in the format: item (space) booth (space) price
        (inserted [ENTER] key character).  Using this format, and the &quot;focus&quot; code
        which is executed after each scan entry, the user can continually scan
        multiple items into each ticket, without using the keyboard.  Manual
        keyboard-only entry is also supported.
