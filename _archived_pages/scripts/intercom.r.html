excerpt: "
        A walkie-talkie push-to-talk type of VOIP application.  Extremely simple -
        just records sound from mic to .wav file, then transfers the wave file to
        another IP (where the same program is running), for playback.  Sender
        and receiver open in separate processes, and both run in forever loops
        to enable continuous communication back and forth.  (Can be run hands
        free by removing the the two &quot;Ask&quot; lines and uncommenting the &quot;wait 2&quot;
        comment, in the second forever loop).
