license: "none"
excerpt: "The is a complete program (as opposed to a code sample) 
    that plays a .wav file.  It is an annotated modification of a script 
    sent to the author in response to a question on the REBOL mailing list,
    namely, how to find out how long a .wav file will play.                
    Besides playing a sound file, this script is annotated to explain how
    to make a progress bar that tracks the playing time.  Its main usefulness
    probably is as an explanation of how to use the progress bar, a more
    detailed explanation than seems to be in the VID documentation."
