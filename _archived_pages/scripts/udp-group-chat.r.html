title: "UDP Group Chat"
excerpt: "
        Because this script uses UDP,  anyone who runs it on a local network will
        automatically receive messages broadcast by others on the same network.
        A separate server program and/or connection(s) to specific IP addresses
        are NOT required.  A &quot;who's online&quot; function is included to list all currently
        logged in users.
