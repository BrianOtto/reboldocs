excerpt: "A function which combines a set of Rebol values and returns them 
              as one of a number of datatypes specified by refinements. The
              default return datatype is string.
              
              Raises a script error if input not valid for requested datatype
              
              Based on an idea in Carl Sassenrath's weblog and subsequent
              discussions including Geomol & Sunanda on the Rebol3 AltMe World"
