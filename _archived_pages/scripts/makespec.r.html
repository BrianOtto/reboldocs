excerpt: "(See MakeDoc2 for the latest version.)
We use this script to save a lot of time when writing specification documents here at REBOL HQ. Very little notation is required to produce good looking HTML documents with titles, table of contents, section headers, indented fixed-spaced examples, &quot;sidebars&quot;, and more. Does all the formatting so we can focus on writing the words (the hard part)."
