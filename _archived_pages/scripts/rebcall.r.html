excerpt: " Call DLL functions efficiently with REBOL/View without the need for REBOL/View/Pro or REBOL/Command.
		This script only works on Windows with a patched REBOL interpreter.
		Details available at http://mortimer.devcave.net/projects/rebcall
		
		Actually only the types that fits in 32 bits are supported
		for the parameters. Thus decimal! values are not.
		
		It could also work on future REBOL/Core, here are the requierements:
			- get-env has to be defined (and get process environment variables)
			- struct! datatype must be available.
