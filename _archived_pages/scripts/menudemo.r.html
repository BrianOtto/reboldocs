title: "Menu demo, using choice"
license: "none"
excerpt: "Two purposes.  Number one, to break down a menu demo from
    Nick Antonaccio into such small pieces that I am able to understand
    each piece, and thus the whole.  Number two, to offer an idea of how
    to write a REBOL script that demonstrates how to write a REBOL script.
    This idea has been done before, so this is not completely new, just
    different.  It also shows how to use a scrolling text area as a nice
    side benefit."
