excerpt: "
        Given an HTML or XML file, shifts all tags to lowercase.
        Everything in the tag is lowercased, so you will need to
        inspect the resulting file names, etc. But, for most
        files this is easier than doing it manually. (Also shows
        how easy it is to do this kind of conversion.)
