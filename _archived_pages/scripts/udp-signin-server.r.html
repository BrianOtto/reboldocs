excerpt: "
        Together with %udp-signin-client.r this program alerts users on a network
        that a new user has arrived and logged in.  Client users are only notified
        when the new user has signed in specificly to see them.  Because this script
        uses UDP, the client alarm application does not need to connect to any
        specific IP.  Anyone who runs the client on the local network will automatically
        receive notifications broadcast over the network.
        These scripts are simplified parts of a larger sign-in application that is used
        at my music lesson business.  When students arrive, they sign in at a front
        desk kiosk machine.  Student attendance information is logged, and the
        teachers get a voice announcement, in their studio, that their &quot;next student
        has arrived&quot; (they are only notified when one of their own students has arrived).
