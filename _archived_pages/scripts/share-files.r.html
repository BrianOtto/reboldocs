excerpt: "
        I use it to send lists of files to clients' phones, PCs, or any other
        Internet device they may use.  I text or email them the single short
        personal html file link created by the script, and they click the 
        contained file links to download all their files. It's a stupid simple
        script and setup which requires only a single unstructured folder on
        any available web server, to handle all the files for any number of
        potential clients, but it's a huge time saver that gets used for so
        many different practical purposes, with so many people, in so many
        situations. It's much more universally usable and straightforward
        than a service such as Dropbox.  No client software needs to be
        installed (just use any browser to download the files).
