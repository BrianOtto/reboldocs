excerpt: "
        Record your voice or other sounds to be played as alarms for
        any number of multiple events.  Save and Load event lists.  All
        alarm sounds repeat until stopped.  Record yourself saying 'wake
        up you lazy bum' or 'hey dude, get up and walk the dog', then 
        set alarms to play those voice messages on any given day/time.
        If you set the alarm as a date/time, the alarm will go off only once,
        on that date.  If you set the alarm as a time, the alarm will go off
        every day at that time.  The .wav recording code is MS Windows
        only, but the program can play any wave file that is usable in
        REBOL.
