excerpt: "
        Demonstrates a useful app created from the formserver.r script. 
        This app generates an HTML form based on user specs (any number of
        check, radio, and text entry items), and starts a server to receive survey
        responses from the audience (they all connect to the LAN server using
        phones or any other Wifi Internet device).  The survey responses are all 
        saved to a user-specified file and an included demo report displays all
        submitted entries, plus a total list of all check items and radio selections.
        Then it presents a bar chart displaying the survey's check and radio results.
