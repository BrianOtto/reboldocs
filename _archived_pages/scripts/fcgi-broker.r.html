license: "bsd"
excerpt: "Rebol script broker for a hooked rebol interpreter launched as a FastCGI application.
		This is the root script which runs others scripts on request of the FastCGI peer.
	
		This enables REBOL/Core or REBOL/View to act as a FastCGI application without the need
		for REBOL/Command.
	
		This script only works on Windows with a patched REBOL interpreter.
		Details available at http://mortimer.devcave.net/projects/rebfcgi
