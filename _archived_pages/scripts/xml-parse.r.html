title: "A more XML 1.0 compliant set of XML parsing tools."
excerpt: "
        REBOL's built-in parse-xml function lacks a number of 
        XML 1.0 compliant features, including:
        - support for CDATA sections
        - support for XML Namespaces
        - exposure of the internal DTD subset

        The intent of this script is to create an XML parser
        that can operate either via an event/callback mechanism,
        or produce a block structure similar to REBOL's built-in
        parse-xml function.

        This XML parser is designed to call-back into a 
        'parse-handler' object that has been designed to be similar
        to the well-known XML parsing interface known as &quot;SAX&quot;
        (Simple API for XML) by David Megginson.

        For more information on SAX, see David's website at:
        http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html

        Several parse-handlers are included here:
        - the base 'class' xml-parse-handler that contains only empty 
          callback stubs
        - the debugging aid echo-handler that prints out the callback
          event stream
        - the block-handler that produces a superset of the block structure
          created by REBOL's built-in parse-xml function

        Alternatively, you may choose to build your own parse
        event handler rather than use the functionality provided
        here.

        A new function is defined &quot;parse-xml+&quot; that represents
        the enhanced counterpart to the built-in REBOL parse-xml.

        Additional features provided by this parser:
        1.  Document prolog information

            The built-in REBOL parse-xml function returns a set of
            nested blocks where the first two items in the outermost
            block are the words document and none, such as:
            [document none [...]]

            The parse-xml+ function provided herein can produce a
            set of nested blocks where the second item of the outermost
            block is used to represent prolog and document type
            information.

            An example of this block is:

            [   version &quot;1.0&quot; encoding &quot;utf-8&quot; standalone &quot;yes&quot;
                doctype none pubid none sysid none subset none
            ]

        2. CDATA Section Processing

           XML provides for enclosing data content within CDATA
           sections for the convenience of avoiding the need to
           escape certain XML sensitive characters in the data
           such as the ampersand (&) and less-than-sign (<).

           An example of a CDATA section:

           <foo>abc <![CDATA[Jack & Jill]]> xyz</foo>

           A compliant XML parser would report that the content 
           of element 'foo' is &quot;abc Jack & Jill xyz&quot;. 

           CDATA sections are also useful when putting text samples
           of XML within the content of an XML document.

           <example><![CDATA[<foo>bar</foo>]]></example>

           Here the value of element 'example' is the text
           &quot;<foo>bar</foo>&quot;

        3. Comments

           This parser provides the opportunity to process 
           comments embedded within the XML.

        4. Processing Instructions

           This parser provides the opportunity to process 
           processing instructions embedded within the XML.

           <foo><?my-app this is a processing instruction?></foo>

        5. Automatic Character Entity Expansion

           In XML document it is common to encounter &quot;character
           entities&quot; within the content of the document.  These
           entities are the means for escaping sensitive XML 
           characters so that the character will be processed as
           data rather than markup.  The most common characters
           that are subjected to this treatment are the 
           ampersand (&) and less-than-sign (<).

           This parser recognizes these common entities and
           automatically converts them to their character 
           equivalents.

           For example:

           <foo>Jack &amp; Jill</foo>

           This parser will automatically replace the &amp;
           character entity reference to the ampersand (&)
           character; hence, the value of element 'foo' is
           &quot;Jack & Jill&quot;.

           Character entities can also be encoded with their
           Unicode numeric equivalent rather than the symbolic
           name in either decimal or hex form, such as:

           <foo>Ampersands: &amp;&#38;&#x26;</foo>

           The value of element 'foo' is &quot;Ampersands: &&&&quot;.

        6. Namespace Processing

           Namespace processing is vital to handling real-world
           XML.
