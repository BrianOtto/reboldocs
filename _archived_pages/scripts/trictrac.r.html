        A quick implementation of a simple board game.  Created with a 
        student as a tutorial example.
        The point is to roll the dice, and match the rolled number with
        any combination of available number buttons above.  For example,
        if you roll a 6, you can match it with the number button 6, or
        5 + 1, or 4 + 2, or 3 + 2 + 1, etc.  Once a number button has
        been selected, it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.
        The game is over when you have no possible combinations of number
        buttons to match the rolled value.  To determine your final score,
        sum the remaining number buttons (see the bottom left of the
        screen).  The goal is to get the lowest final score.  When playing
        against others, each player takes turns clearing the board - or
        you can just play against yourself, always trying to get the
        lowest possible score.
        Another way to play is to count the total number of rolls required
        to clear the board.  The goal is to turn all the buttons in the
        fewest number of rolls.  To make this game go faster, play with
        only numbers 5-10.
