excerpt: "Display a basic chess board and some
    		moveable counters (use a mouse to drag and drop). The
    		most-recently selected counter comes to the front, if it
    		was obscured by other counters.
    		Intended as a get-you-started set of ideas if you intend
    		to write a board game, and a demo of VID feel and other
    		useful techniques"
