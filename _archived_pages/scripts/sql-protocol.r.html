excerpt: "
		SQL-PROTOCOL is a SQL Relationnal Database Management System (RDBMS) entirely written in REBOL 
		with JOIN and SORT capability. This allow you having an easy to use lightweight database engine embeded
		in your REBOL application.
		
		Today, sql-protocol execute only these kind of query :
		* SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...
		* INSERT ... INTO ... VALUES ...
		* UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
		* DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...
		* CREATE TABLE ...
		* DROP TABLE ...
		
		Query can be submited either as a standard SQL query string or as a SQL like query dialect block.
		* by using SQL query string you will have a better compatibility with other database system like MySQL, Oracle or DB2.
		* by using SQL query dialect you will get advantage of REBOL scripting facility.
		
		This quick example illustrates how to load the protocol, open a database, 
		select some rows from two tables, probe the result and close the database.
		
		Using standard SQL query string :
		
		    do %sql-protocol.r
		    db: open sql:my-db
		    insert db {
		        SELECT * FROM a, b
		        WHERE a.c2 = b.c1 AND a.c1 = 1
		        ORDER BY 1, 2 DESC
		    }
		    foreach item copy db [probe item]
		    close db
		
		The same using the SQL dialect :
		
		    do %sql-protocol.r
		    db: open sql:my-db
		    insert db [
		        SELECT * FROM a b
		        WHERE a.c2 = b.c1 AND a.c1 = 1
		        ORDER BY 1 [2 DESC]
		    ]
		    foreach item copy db [probe item]
		    close db
		
		Moreover, sql-protocol provide a basic compabibility with the ODBC text driver {Microsoft text driver (*.csv,*.txt)} 
		in order to provide a quick and simple way to share data between REBOL application and any ODBC application,
		for example, MS Excel to produce table or chart,or MS Word to produce letters or mailing.
		
		sql-protocol provide also a set of file protocol which can be used directly in your script :
		DATA:  - text file containing a REBOL block for each row
		HEAP:  - same as DATA but for transient table (in memory table)
		CSV:   - delimited file by any caracter except doublequote (&quot;), newline (
) or linefeed ().
