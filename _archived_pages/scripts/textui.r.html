title: "TextUI - Textual User Interface"
excerpt: "
        Open source REBOL is currently being ported to platforms without
        GUI support.  This script is a simple replacement for GUIs that collect
        text input from fields and drop down lists.  Just specify a block of
        labels, and a block of default values for each field ('answers).  If the
        the 'answers block contains a nested block, the values in that
        block with be used as items in a list selector (so that users don't
        need to type a long response and/or can select from a pre-defined
        list of options - similar to a GUI text-list or drop-down selector).

        This works in both R2 and R3, with only minimal console support
        (currently operational on Android).
