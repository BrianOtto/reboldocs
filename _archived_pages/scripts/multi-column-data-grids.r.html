title: "Multiple Column Data Grids"
excerpt: "
        A demonstration of how to create your own home made &quot;listview&quot;
        types of multiple column data grids.   Easier to use than the 'list 
        style, and built entirely using native VID, so completely adjustable
        to your needs.  Many useful features are demonstrated, such as
        user editing of data in the grid, saving and loading of data to/from
        files, row addition and removal, column extract, easily adjustable
        look and feel, etc.
        Taken from the tutorial at http://musiclessonz.com/rebol.html
