excerpt: "
      After learning Rebol 1.3 could place itself in the System Tray on Windows,
      and after finding Graham's example, I decided to make a slightly simpler
      version of the System Tray dialect.

      Since it's based on Graham's example, it may well be missing stuff...

      Later note:  This was also an experiment for me, learning the parse dialect.
