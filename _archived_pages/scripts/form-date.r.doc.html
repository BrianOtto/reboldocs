 USAGE:
     FORM-DATE date format /gmt

      format -- (Type: any-string)

 REFINEMENTS:
      /gmt -- Align time with GMT
 </pre>     <a name="toc-4"></a><h2>4. The format string</h2>       <p> Ordinary characters placed in the format string are inserted into return value without conversion.  Conversion specifications are introduced by a <strong>%</strong> character, and terminated by a conversion  specifier character, and are replaced and inserted into return value as follows:</p><table border="1">  <tr>  <td>  <strong>%a</strong>     </td><td> The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%A</strong>     </td><td> The full weekday name according to the current locale.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%b</strong>     </td><td> The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%B</strong>     </td><td> The full month name according to the current locale.  </td></tr><tr>  <td> <strong>%c</strong>      </td><td> The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.  In this case the <strong>locale</strong> is REBOLand, with a little %b mixed in.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%C</strong>     </td><td> The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%d</strong>     </td><td> The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%D</strong>     </td><td> Equivalent  to %Y/%m/%d.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%e</strong>     </td><td> Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, without a leading zero.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%G</strong>    </td><td> The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number.  The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see  %V).   This  has the  same  format  and  value as %y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year  is  used instead.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%g</strong>     </td><td> Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>   <strong>%H</strong>   </td><td> The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00  to 23).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>   <strong>%i</strong>     </td><td> The english suffix for numeric value, st for 01, th for 04.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>   <strong>%I</strong>     </td><td> The  hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%j</strong>     </td><td> The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%J</strong>    </td><td>  Like %j, but without leading zeroes.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%m</strong>   </td><td> The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%M</strong>   </td><td>  The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%p</strong>    </td><td> Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time  value.  Noon is treated as "PM" and midnight as "AM".  </td></tr><tr>  <td> <strong>%s</strong>     </td><td> The second as a decimal number 00-60 with REBOL nanosecond precision, a period followed by 6 digits.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%S</strong>    </td><td> The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The range  is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%t</strong>     </td><td> A tab character.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%T</strong>    </td><td> The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%u</strong>    </td><td> The  day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%U</strong>   </td><td>  The week number of the current year as a decimal  number,  range 00  to  53,  starting  with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%V</strong>   </td><td> The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as  a  decimal number,  range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the current year,  and  with  Monday  as  the first day of the week. See also %U and %W.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%w</strong>  </td><td> The  day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%W</strong>  </td><td> The week number of the current year as a decimal  number,  range 00  to  53,  starting  with the first Monday as the first day of week 01.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%y</strong>   </td><td>  The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%Y</strong>   </td><td> The year as a decimal number including the century.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%Z</strong>   </td><td> The  time-zone  as  hour  offset  from  GMT.  </td></tr><tr>  <td>  <strong>%%</strong>  </td><td> A literal "%" character.  </td></tr></table>    <a name="toc-5"></a><h2>5. What you can learn</h2>        <p> The <strong>interpolate</strong> function, along with <strong>date-codes</strong> is  an excellent example of <strong>parse</strong>.  The dialect created is the two character  format specifiers that produce the date and time pieces.  A strftime dialect.</p><p> REBOL can emulate the functionality of other systems, while still remaining REBOL.</p><p> REBOL code can look world-class elegant when properly formatted and factored.</p><a name="toc-6"></a><h2>6. What you can break</h2>        <p> The date! parameter has to be a date!.  If you use any time related format specifiers, it  has to be a date! that includes time information or returned fields may be incorrect.</p><pre class="mdp-example">
