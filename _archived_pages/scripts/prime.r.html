excerpt: "
       Address the question, could this integer be a prime number?
       results of false are not prime, 
       results of true are very probably prime 
       and with the /strong refinement, ( I still have to verify this )
       true ( should ) guarantee prime.

       if the argument is outside the domain of the function,
       none is returned
