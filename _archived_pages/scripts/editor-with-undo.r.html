excerpt: "

        Demonstrates how alter REBOL's built in text editor.  Romano Paolo
        Tenca's &quot;edit-text-undo&quot; (http://www.rebol.it/romano/edit-text-undo.txt)
        is incorporated.  The color scheme and help text in the editor are also
        adjusted.  The key to making the changes is in the lines:

        ctx-edit: mold :ctx-edit
        (make changes to the code in ctx-edit)
        ctx-edit: do ctx-edit
