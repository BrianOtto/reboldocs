excerpt: "
    This script shows how to implement an XPath interpreter in Rebol/Prolog.
    This interpreter is not complete. 
    It is only a kind of &quot;Proof of Concept&quot;. It lacks some features.
    Currently it can parse a document containing elements, attributes and pcdata. 
    In this script I see an xml document as a tree of UNTYPED nodes. 
    Consequently,
	- all nodes are treated the same, In particular attributes of an element are seen as child nodes of that element
	- the syntax DOES NOT FOLLOW exactly the XPath syntax (See the EXAMPLES below to understand how it works).
    Note1: It could be perfectly possible to directly parse XML data instead of rebxml data 
    but it would be more difficult to write the parse_doc function. A solution could be to adapt xml2rebxml so that it produces the db atomic facts."
