excerpt: "
        Given a file spec, and optional criteria for date, size,
        and attributes, the FILE-LIST function returns a block of
        files that match the spec and criteria.

        It is also a test-bed for how to integrate dialects with
        one-another. There are sub-dialects for date, size, and
        attribute tests, and FILE-LIST encapsulates those, along
        with the LIKE? dialect for pattern matching on file names.
        There are things I don't like about the approach, but we
        can learn from it if nothing else (and it does actually
        work, too :).

        You will see commented bits, possible refinements and
        various design decisions. Implementation is not the hard
        part. The hard part is designing something that works
        well, and intuitively (as in the principle of least
        surprise).

        There will undoubtedly also be cross-platform issues that
        need to be addressed.
