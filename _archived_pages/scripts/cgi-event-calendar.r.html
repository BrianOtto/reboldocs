excerpt: "

        A web site CGI application that displays events in the current
        calendar month, with links to specified event pages.  Events
        are stored in the file %bb.db, in the format:

        [&quot;event 1&quot; 18-Apr-2010 http://website.com/event1.html]
        [&quot;event 2&quot; 20-Apr-2010 http://website.com/event2.html]
        [&quot;event 3&quot; 20-Apr-2010 http://website.com/event3.html]

        This script uses code derived from Bohdan Lechnowsky's &quot;HTML calendar&quot;. 
        Taken from the tutorial at http://re-bol.com
