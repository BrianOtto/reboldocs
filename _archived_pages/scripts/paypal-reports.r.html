title: "Paypal Reports"
excerpt: "

        This is a beginner's example taken from the tutorial at:

        http://re-bol.com/business_programming.html

        It creates reports on columns and rows of data in a .csv table.

        The script demonstrates typical CSV file operations using parse, foreach,
        and simple series functions. The code performs sums upon columns, and
        selective calculations upon specified fields, based upon conditional
        evaluations, searches, etc.  The script automatically handles tables with
        any arbitrary number of columns, allowing fields to be referred to by
        labels present in the first line of the .csv file.

        Practical column and row based reporting capabilities such as this are a
        simple and useful skill in REBOL.  Using basic permutations of techniques
        shown here, it's easy to surpass the capabilities of spreadsheets and
        other &quot;office&quot; reporting software.

        For more information about how to obtain CSV data from Paypal, and a 
        line-by-line explanation of the code, see:
