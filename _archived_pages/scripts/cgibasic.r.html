excerpt: "This is a collection of functions that could be used in a
    CGI program.  There is nothing in this module that has not been done
    better by others, but the code is more heavily annotated for beginners.
    Separate documentation explains how to use the functions.  The comments
    should be helpful also.  None of this is my original creation. I just
    assembled and annotated, mainly so I could use it and understand it."
