title: "Guitar Chord and Scale Diagrammer"
excerpt: "
        A little example for the new tutorial at:
             http://re-bol.com/starting_computer_programming_with_rebol.html
        When the program starts, enter the number of frets you want in your diagram.
        (The default is 5 frets, but you could use 3 or 4 for smaller diagrams, 
        or more for full fretboard scale diagrams)
        Click any fret on any string to add a dot (finger position).
        Click any added dot to remove it (change it back to an empty position).
        Right-Click any fret on any string to add a character of your choice.
        (You could use this to add finger numbers, root note labels, interval labels, etc.)
        Click the title text (&quot;Chord Name&quot;) to give the chord or scale a name.
        Right-Click the title to save the diagram to a .png image.
        (The default image file name is the title text entered above)
