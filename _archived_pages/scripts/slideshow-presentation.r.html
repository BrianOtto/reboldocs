title: "Simple Slideshow Presentation Framework"
excerpt: "

        This example is taken from the tutorial at:

        http://re-bol.com/business_programming.html

        It demonstrates a simple framework for presenting full screen GUI
        layouts with built-in keyboard and mouse controls.  It simplifies coding
        tediously repetitive layout elements, by only requiring unique GUI 
        elements in each slide. Widgets and layout code to appear in all
        slides can be inserted in the &quot;forever&quot; loop. This example separates out
        the title, the text background box color/effect, and layout code to
        appear in each unique slide, and adds forward and back key/mouse 
        controls, bar lines (black boxes), and colors to appear in every slide. 
        To create your own slides, all you need to do is edit the unique code
        to appear in each individual slide layout (title string and unique GUI
        code for each slide):
