excerpt: "
        This example demonstrates how to use the Windows API to adjust the title bar
        in your Rebol programs.  Just include this code in your script if you need
		to eliminate the default 'Rebol - ' text at the top of your GUI programs.  
        Taken from the tutorial at http://musiclessonz.com/rebol_tutorial.html
