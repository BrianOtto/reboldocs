title: "Resizeable Table/Grid/Multi-column List Widget Example"
excerpt: "
        One of the greatest things about REBOL/View is the built in GUI dialect
            (&quot;VID&quot;).  It's great for building simple GUI layouts quickly and
            easily, but the native list widget can be confusing for newcomers.
        THIS EXAMPLE IS A FULL FEATURED TABLE/GRID/LIST WIDGET FOR VID GUIs.
            KEYS:  INSERT  DELETE  ARROWS  PAGE UP/DOWN  - +  F1  CTRL+R M S O F U
            MOUSE: click header to sort, RIGHT-CLICK/DRAG to RESIZE, click to edit
        Columns can be SORTED and *RESIZED* by clicking the headers.  Data can be
            EDITED by clicking cells.  Rows can be added, removed, and moved with
            the INSERT, DELETE, and CTRL+M keys.  Data blocks can be loaded and
            saved to/from files, in both &quot;flattened&quot; and sub-block formats, using
            the CTRL+S CTRL+L CTRL+F and CTRL+U keys.  Column format (color, font,
            etc.) can be easily specified in the column code.  Alternate rows are
            automatically shaded, and mousing-over a row highlights the current
            row.  Up and down arrow keys, and page up/down keys can be used to
            scroll.  The mouse can also be used to scroll (with the scroll bar).
            Data can be reverted to the last saved change (by clicking the &quot;r&quot;
            button in the GUI).  The entire grid can be resized to any percentage,
            with automatic sizing of columns (use the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; keys to resize
            this example).  The entire grid size will also automatically adjust to
            fit a resized screen.  Press [F1] for help.
        The compressed code adds all necessary functionality to VID's native list
            widget - paste it as-is into your script (uncompress to see how it
            works, or to make changes).
        Keep the variables and naming coventions as they are in the GUI code (the
            variables gui, gui-size, t-size, x, y, li, list-size, sl, sl-size,
            s-pos, and my-supply need to be changed in the compressed code if ever
            changed in the GUI layout).
        You can add as many columns as needed to your own GUI grids:
            Headers must be labeled h1, h2, h3...  Put DIFFERENT TEXT in each.
            Columns must be labeled col1, col2, col3...  Format each as needed.
        &quot;header-block&quot; must be edited to contain each of the header labels (i.e.,
            if your table has headers h1, h2, and h3, the header block should be
            [h1/text h2/text h3/text]).
        &quot;x&quot; holds the data displayed in the table - you can save, load, and
            manipulate it directly, then refresh the display (try the CTRL+S and
            CTRL+O keys in the GUI example to save and load the grid data).
        Rows of data are each stored in a SEPARATE block within the &quot;x&quot; block.
            To &quot;flatten&quot; the block (i.e., to save the grid data in one large
            block, without sub-blocks), try the CTRL+F keys in this GUI example.
            To load a flattened block, try the CTRL+U keys.
        &quot;y&quot; holds a copy of the original data (click the &quot;r&quot; button in the GUI
            example to reload it and refresh the display to its last saved state).
        &quot;feel editstyle&quot; is used to make a column EDITABLE.  Click any cell in the
            GUI example to edit.  These changes are made directly to the &quot;x&quot; block
            and then the GUI is refreshed.
        &quot;feel slidestyle&quot; is used to make a column RESIZABLE (RIGHT CLICK/drag the 
            header to expand or contract any column width).  This function also
            contains the &quot;sort-column&quot; function, which allows the user to sort
            columns of data by clicking the header.
        &quot;sort-column&quot; sorts the selected column number.  Each call to this
            function alternates between ascending and descending sort order.
        &quot;key-scroll&quot; enables keyboard scrolling (use the up/down cursor keys, and
            page up/down keys in this GUI example).
        &quot;add-line&quot; adds a row of data to the grid, at a chosen index (use the
            [INSERT] key in this GUI example).
        &quot;remove-line&quot; removes a selected row of data (use the [DELETE] key in this
            GUI example).
        &quot;move-line&quot; moves a row of data from one selected index to another (use
            the CTRL+M keys in this GUI example to move rows).
        &quot;resize-fit&quot; resizes the table to fit the GUI, with equally sized columns.
            The compressed code contains an insert-event-function which 
            automatically resizes the table to fit the GUI window, when resized.
            Press CTRL+R in this GUI example to execute the function manually.
        &quot;resize-grid&quot; resizes the table a given percentage (press the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;
            keys in this GUI example to see it work).
        Notice that the majority of user-editable code in the GUI consists of
            headers, column names and formatting, and &quot;key&quot; widgets to run the
            desired functions.  In this example GUI, the user presses keystroke
            combinations to activate the desired features, but those functions
            could also be added to the action blocks of buttons, and/or executed
            by any other typical trigger.
