excerpt: "
        Demonstrates how to use the Windows API to make a Rebol
        application always stay on top of other windows (so that the
        Rebol window is always visible in front of any other programs
        that are opened).  Be sure to use the view/new option, then
        run the 2 Windows API functions, then do-events to show the
        GUI.
