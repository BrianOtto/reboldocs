excerpt: "
        This examples demonstrates how to use REBOL's native GUI list
        widget to manage a grid of data values.  Columns can be sorted
        by clicking the headers.  Individual values at any column/row
        position can be edited by the user (just click the current value).
        Entire rows can be added, removed, or moved to/from user-selected
        positions.  The data block can be saved or loaded to/from file(s).
        Scrolling can be done with the mouse, arrow keys, or page-up/
        page-down keys.  Several resizing concepts are also demonstrated.
