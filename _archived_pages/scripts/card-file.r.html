excerpt: "
        This is the quintessential simple text field storage application. 
        It can be used as shown here, to save contact information, but by
        adjusting just a few lines of code and text labels, it could be easily
        adapted to store recipes, home inventory information, or any other
        type of related pages of data.
 
        A version of this script with line-by-line documentation is available
        at http://re-bol.com
