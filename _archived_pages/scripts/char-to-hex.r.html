excerpt: "Convert an ASCII char to a two hex code.  This is just one of
           those things in Rebol where you waste time looking for a solution
           to an otherwise extremely simple problem because the obvious
           doesn't work (ie: to-hex &quot;M&quot; doesn't work because to-hex wants
           an integer and to-integer wants a character not a string)!  The
           C2I function is thrown in for completeness."
