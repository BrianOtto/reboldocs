excerpt: "
        Provides functions, and an object def that uses them, to treat
        a series as a priority queue. When you insert items, you give
        them a priority (higher numbers mean a higher priority). In the
        actual series, the priority is stored along with the value, so
        you should always use the pq* functions to access them, to make
        things easier.
