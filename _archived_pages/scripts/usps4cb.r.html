excerpt: "This is a program to load the United States Postal Service
    Windows library for creating the new Intelligent Mail Barcode.        
    It is designed to be included in a calling program, and it provides 
    a function to generate a coding string, which in turn may be printed in
    a proper barcode font to produce an Intelligent Mail Barcode.
    Normally, one would use this program along with the Windows library
    downloaded from the postal service.  However, for demo purposes, a
    compressed version of that library is included in the source so you
    can verify that this program actually works."
