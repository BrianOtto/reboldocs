excerpt: "a-reb-site.r was written to:
               -  compare form and function of a reb-site with that of a conventional web-site.
                  (...an obliging web-site - www.rebol.com perhaps!) & 
               - to provide an example of a reb-site script, & 
               - as an illustration of the compact size of a reb-site relative
                 to the average web-site (or page)."
