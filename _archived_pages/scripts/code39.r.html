license: "none"
excerpt: "
		Generates Code 39 barcode images which can be printed out and read with a
		standard barcode reader.

		Code 39 is limited to the alphanumeric characters listed in the 'code39
		block within the function.

		It is a very popular barcode format in the US and doesn't need to conform
		to any particular length of characters and has no limitations placed on it
		by any sanctioning body regarding what it can be used for.

		This version does not support checksum digits, but this could be added
		easily.  Perhaps in a future version.

		Wrote this to generate barcodes for my corporation, &quot;RespecTech, Inc.&quot;, to
		internally track inventory.
