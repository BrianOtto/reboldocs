excerpt: "

        This example downloads and parses the current (live) US Dollar 
        exchange rates from http://x-rates.com.  The user selects from
        a list of currencies to convert to, then performs and displays the
        conversion from USD to the selected currency.  All of the parsing
        occurs when the &quot;Convert&quot; button is clicked.  The first half of the
        script is the simple Calculator GUI example taken from the first
        part of the tutorial at:

        http://re-bol.com/business_programming.html
