title: "REBOL Heavy Script Cleaner (Pretty Printer)"
license: "none"
excerpt: "
        Based on Carls %clean-script.r
        Cleans (pretty prints) REBOL scripts by parsing the REBOL code
        and supplying standard indentation and spacing.
      Breaks now every bracket/paren it finds (thus &quot;heavy&quot;).
        If you have a really messed up script, 
        like %ascii-chart.r from the library, 
        you have a chance to make it readable. 
        Don't use with already readable Scripts..
