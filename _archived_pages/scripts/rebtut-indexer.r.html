excerpt: "Was tired looking up visually the index page for any article containing a specific keyword.
			  
			  For now the script loads and parses the original articles' index page duirectly from the Rebtutorial.com web site, 
			  splitting URL links apart from their descriptions, and while counting them it appends them to a block 
			  that can be searched by keyword. 
			  
			  Every occurence is itself appended into a list that displays itself when the verbose mode is set to 'true. 
			  
			  Furthermore, for the time being, you'll have to manually delete the many comments included here
			  for documentation and exploration of another auto-doc selective help system, inspired by the comments section of
			  the dynamic dictionary (%word-browser.r script) found in the RebWorld - Tools folder.
			  
			  See the EXAMPLES section for more info and the look I originally plan to have.
			  Every suggestion is welcome and appreciated. Eventually I would prefer to develop a RSpec like product
			  for keeping executables specs in sync with Unit tests (%rUnit.r) of the xUnit family.
