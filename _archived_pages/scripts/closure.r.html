title: "Closure"
excerpt: "
        CLOSURE is suggested instead of FUNC when you need functions
		exhibiting async behaviour,	e.g. for:
		- View
		- Async Ports
		- Higher Order Functions
		
		Closures differ from &quot;normal&quot; Rebol functions by using a fresh
		context every time they are called.
		
		Rule of thumb: if your function is returning a new function, block, or
		a local word, you will be safe if it is a closure.
