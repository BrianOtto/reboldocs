excerpt: "
		http://users.iol.it/irwin/
		uSQLite is a network wrapper for SQLite. It turns SQLite into an RDBMS but 
		puts the emphasis on the 'Lite'. In fact it works in a somewhat unconventional
		mmanner in order to make both servers and clients as light, portable and 
		simple as possible. Readers who are not familiar with SQLite are advised 
		to visit www.sqlite.org.
		uSQLite uses the TechFell protocol for communications between clients and servers.
