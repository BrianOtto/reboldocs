excerpt: "
        Find an index in a sorted list, at which an item must occur,
        if the item exists in the list.
        in time porportional to log-2 of the number of items in the list.
        NOTE WELL no effort is made to confirm the series is actually sorted.
        returns none if the input arguments are (detectably) flawed
        returns a index of a match OR an index adjecent to
        where in the list the item would be found if it existed.
