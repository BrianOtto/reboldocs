excerpt: "
		Easy-Soccer is a broker based on CGI which offer an easy way 
		to write and the deploy distributed Rebol application.
		
		Easy-Soccer makes very easy to expose function written in Rebol like services.
		Thus, you can use these functions as if they were defined locally.

		In a distributed environment Easy-Soccer uses a simple WEB server
		and CGI to execute Rebol code on the server. HTTP is used for the 
		transport of the messages like SOAP or X-RPC and so goes easily thru firewalls.

		Easy-Soccer allows not only to publish remote function, but can also provide
		the client part of the application. So you can have in the same Rebol script
		the client and the server part of your program.
		
		Even more, Easy-Soccer allows you to run your script as a monolithic application
		without any change and without anything else than your script. In the same spirit,
		if your script use VID, it can be run within REBOL/View or within the REBOL/Plugin
		without any change.
