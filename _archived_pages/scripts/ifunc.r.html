excerpt: "
		Sometimes it is optimal to do some things just once,
		during a &quot;function initialization phase&quot;, instead of doing them
		every time the function is called.
		
		An example of this may be a creation of USE-RULEs, that can be done
		just once, instead of being done every time the function is called.
		
		Such an initialization can be easily done in R2,
		but is problematic in R3 due to &quot;excessive&quot; protection.
		
		This is a way how to circumvent the protection in R3.
