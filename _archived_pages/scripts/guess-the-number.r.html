                       This game will ask you to enter a number
                       and will then say if it is more or less than a predefined random number
                       with best ability and worst luck
                       you will need (log in base 2 of MAX) tries to guess the number
                       (if you are interested in this google &quot;Binary search&quot;)
                       As default MAX: 100
