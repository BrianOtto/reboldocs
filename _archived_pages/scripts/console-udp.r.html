excerpt: "Console IO udp-broadcast instead of echo file!. When rebol echo function! is executed then bcast-on is automaticly closed by rebol, 
scheme: 'file takes over for echo in system/ports/echo. There is no check on udp port, please change to the right port. Use of an 
udp-listen on a remote console/machine can now listen for udp traffic from this console and capture it to file i.e. by use of echo file!
