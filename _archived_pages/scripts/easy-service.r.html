excerpt: "
        Easy-Service is a broker based on REBOL/Service which offer an easy way 
        to write and the deploy distributed Rebol application.
        Easy-Service makes very easy to expose function written in Rebol like REBOL/Services.
        Thus, you can use these functions as if they were defined locally.

        In a distributed environment easy-service uses a simple WEB server
        and CGI to execute Rebol code on the server. HTTP and REBOL/Services are used for the 
        transport layer.

        Easy-service allows not only to publish remote function, but can also provide
        the client part of the application. So you can have in the same Rebol script
        the client and the server part of your program.
        
        Even more, easy-service allows you to run your script as a monolithic application
        without any change and without anything else than your script. In the same spirit,
        if your script use VID, it can be run within REBOL/View or within the REBOL/Plugin
        without any change.
