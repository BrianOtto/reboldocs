excerpt: "
        This script is a virtual shrink &quot;chatter bot&quot;.
        It was obviously inspired by the original shrink bot
        called Eliza. When the program gets a sentence in
        English, it tries to find a matching rule in its    
        rule database and if it understands the sentence
        it tries to give a reasonable reply.
        (Type &quot;quit&quot; to quit)
