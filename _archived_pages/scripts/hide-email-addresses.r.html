title: "Hide E-Mail Addresses by using Javascript"
license: "none"
excerpt: "This will take a web page and find all the &quot;mailto:aaa@bbb&quot; and
             convert the addresses to variables for use in Javascript.  This
             effectively 'hides' the addressess from webbot e-mail address
             harvesters.
             Note: This script expects the opening tag (<a href=&quot;mailto:...&quot;>)
             and the closing tag (</a>) to be on one or at most two lines. "
