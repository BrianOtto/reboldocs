excerpt: "Emulates, with a few lines of Rebol code, the &quot;CommServer&quot; flash XML socket 
server from Moock and Clayton.(see www.moock.org for the flash client.)
The server sends a simple xml doc like <NUMCLIENTS>numclients</NUMCLIENTS>
as soon as someone enters or leaves the server.
By updating and comparing the old and updated value of numclients, The Flash
client knows if someone has entered or left the room. Plus: if a numclient is
received as the text field is empty, the client displays its welcome message.
Simple and efficient :)
This script adds a user limit feature.
I am currently discovering Rebol and try to use it with Flash.
This is my first script, be indulgent :)
My current project is a flash multiuser socket server handling
advanced options (rooms and user variables storage).
