excerpt: "The script was intended as a method for writing  scripts.  A layout may
             be written in the editor and then displayed in the same script.  Writers can change
             the script and view the changes without leaving  the editor.

             Reference material may be drawn into the program, reviewed, and even copied
             and pasted into the editor."
