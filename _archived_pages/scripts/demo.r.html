        Amazingly small REBOL demo app:  10 useful programs in only 2.5k
        (LESS THAN HALF A PRINTED PAGE OF CODE!): 

             1 - FREEHAND PAINT:  draw and save graphic images
             2 - SNAKE GAME:  eat food, avoid hitting the walls and yourself  
             3 - TILE PUZZLE, &quot;15&quot;:  arrange the tiles into alphabetical order
             4 - CALENDAR:  save and view events for any date
             5 - VIDEO:  live webcam video viewer - not just static images
             6 - IPs:  display your LAN and WAN IP addresses
             7 - EMAIL:  read emails from any pop account
             8 - COUNT DAYS:  count the days between 2 selected dates
             9 - PLAY SOUNDS:  Browse your computer for wave files to play
             10 - FTP TOOL:  web site editor (browse folders on your server,
                 click files to edit and save changes back to the server,
                 create and edit new files etc.)

        This example is 100% native REBOL.  No external libraries, images, 
        GUI components, or other resources of any kind are imported.  It runs
        on Windows, Mac, Linux, and any other OS supported by REBOL/View.
