excerpt: "
        Insert an item in a series, where the series is treated
        as an MRU list. That is, the newest item is at the head,
        there are no duplicates (inserting a value removes the
        previous instance of that value if it exists), and the
        series may be limited to a specific size. If a new item
        causes the series to grow beyond that size, the last item
        is removed.

        It is often used with menus of recently accessed files.
