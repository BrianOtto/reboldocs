license: "none"
excerpt: "
		This is an enhanced replacement for the original request-date function,
		the embedded date picker in view (datepicker).
		
		- Clean, correct and optimize the code.
		- add day names at top of window (use system/locales/days).
		- add first-day-of-week value to choose starting with Sunday
		  or Monday.
		  (I think this value should be part of system/locales)
		- add Today button at bottom.
		- Today is shown with red circle in calendar.
		
		- New refinment:  'request-date/date a-date  to initialize the calendar.
		  This date is shown with red square in calendar, and is
		  retuned instead of none if the window is closed.
		  
		WARNING ! It needs View 1.2.8+ to work
