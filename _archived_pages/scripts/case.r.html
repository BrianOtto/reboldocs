excerpt: "
        Provide a generalized multiple conditional function for situations that would otherwise call for 
        deeply nested EITHER blocks. CASE is more general than SWITCH because the conditions can be any 
        DO-able block rather than being based on a single value. This can be used simply to allow a 
        SWITCH-like behavior that supports ranges instead of single values, e.g.:
            print case [
              [ lesser? x 1 ] [ &quot;x < 1&quot; ]
              [ equal? x 1 ] [ &quot;x = 1&quot; ]
              [ greater? x 1 ] [ &quot;x > 1&quot;]
            ]
        It can also be used for more complex situations, since any DO-able block can be used for the 
        condition block.
