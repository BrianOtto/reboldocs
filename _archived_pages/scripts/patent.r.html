excerpt: "Downloads various types of patents from the l2.espacenet.com server.
Normally espace forces you to download the patents one page at a time.
This script gets all of the pages for you automatically.
Shows various progress bars and time estimates.
There may be patents that this does not get because I can not
find any documentation on how l2.espacenet encodes its URL's.
If you know how to encode a specific URL please let me know
so that I can add support for it. -  bpaddock@csonline.net

The program is also example of how to use Rebol's:
    request-download
    choice[]
    ProgressBars/Time Estimates
    How to change face text on button press, and how
    to dynamically enable/disable a button.
    Real world application of Events.
