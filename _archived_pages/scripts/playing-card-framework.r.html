title: "Generic Playing Card Game Framework"
excerpt: "
        A simple demonstration of how to use the images in %playing-cards.r
        to create card games.  In this example, the cards are arranged in a way
        that can be used to play the game of Freecell.   The rules of that particular
        game are not enforced in this example, to keep the code simple and under-
        standable (you can play a full game of Freecell with this code alone, but no
        particular moves are allowed or disallowed, stacks of cards can not be moved
        at once, etc.).  See freecell.r for a more complete implementation of the Freecell
        game, using this outline.
