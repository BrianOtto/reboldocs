        Try to click the bouncing REBOLs as many times as possible in 30 seconds.
        The speed increases with each click!  The 3D logic and calculations in this
        script were  taken directly from Gregory Pecheret's &quot;ebuc-cube&quot; script, at:
 
        http://www.rebol.net/demos/download.html
 
        This script can also be found in the tutorial at http://re-bol.com
