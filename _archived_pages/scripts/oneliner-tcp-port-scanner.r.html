license: "none"
excerpt: "This is a simple port scanner. Given a TCP address, it will tell you which of the
first 100 ports are accessible. The address can be a host name or number. For example, use
&quot;localhost&quot; to scan ports on your own machine. You can scan more ports by increasing the
number (from 100), or you can scan ranges by using a FOR loop rather than REPEAT."
