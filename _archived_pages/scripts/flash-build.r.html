excerpt: "
        A simple script to help new users experiment with editing, compiling and viewing
        .swf files created with REBOL/flash.   It uses the built-in REBOL text editor to
        repeatedly run through the edit/compile/run process, so that code changes can
        be made quickly and easily, and the compiled results viewed immediately in the
        browser.
