excerpt: "
         Example of how a webform could be processed by a REBOL script,
         refilling previously filled fields when errors in input are detected.
         For performance it is always better to have some validation (using 
         e.g. Javascript) on the client side first, but for safety the check
         also needs to be (re)done at the server side.
