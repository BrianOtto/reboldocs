license: "none"
excerpt: "
    This script allows you to apply the four classical operations (add, subtract divide, multiply) on very big positive integers. 
    Size of the integers is only limited by the size of a rebol string since numbers are represented as strings.
    When using this script, keep in mind that the operations manipulate &quot;string numbers&quot; in reverse order (see example at the end of the script)"
