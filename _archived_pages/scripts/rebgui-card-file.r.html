title: "RebGUI Card File"
excerpt: "

        This is an implementation of the Card File program at 
        http://www.rebol.org/view-script.r?script=card-file.r
        using RebGUI instead of VID.  Notice that the GUI is resizable,
        the text fields have undo/redo and spellcheck capabilities,
        requestors are modal, and all the other features of RebGUI
        are available.

        Taken from the tutorial at http://re-bol.com
