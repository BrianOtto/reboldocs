excerpt: "This is an idea for packaging up code, plus some small 
    demos of how to do various things, harvested from the cookbook and 
    the mailing list.  They are things that are done so often and in so 
    many situations that the author found it helpful to package them up   
    in a file of personal functions.  All these techniques are shown in
    various places, but this module packages them as complete functions
    instead of demos or ideas.  If an experienced reader looks at them
    and decides that they are terrible ways to do things, that itself
    might be a commentary on the state of REBOL documentation.  Perhaps
    the motto would be, &quot;simple things are simple, and complicated
    things are undocumented.&quot;"
