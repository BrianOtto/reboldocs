excerpt: "
    &quot;Progress Bar With Read-thru&quot; was written to provide  a simple  progress bar script to the REBOL library.  When using REBOL's internal read-thru function, only 5 lines are required to update a progress bar - see note 2. &quot;Read-thru&quot;  is used to download a file to the disk cache - and to provide the data to move the progress bar.  
    
    The method used to retrieve the downloaded file from the disk cache is also illustrated.
