title: "TFACE: Scrolling text face"
license: "none"
excerpt: "This is a module that can be included in a larger program
    with the command 'do %tface.r' and it will provide a function      
    (TFACE-SHOW-TEXT <text-string-parameter>' that will display a passed
    text string in a scrolling window.  This code was copied from the REBOL
    cookbook and annotated so that the copier could understand it."
