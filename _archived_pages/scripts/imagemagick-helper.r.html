excerpt: "Support minimal needs for image processing using ImageMagick MagickWand and MagickCore DLLs 
            Note: DLL's calls tend to change so this is specifically for version 6.2.9
            Note: Original uses only MagickCore DLL. This version required MagickWand DLL because they 
                moved the calls to a different DLL"
