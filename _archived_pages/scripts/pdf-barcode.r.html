excerpt: "
        Takes a given string and XxY coordinate (in millimeters), and outputs
        a PDF file containing a printable bar code at the given position.  The bar
        code algorithm is derived directly from Bohdan Lechnowsky's &quot;code39.r&quot;, 
        and the PDF is generated using Gabriele Santilli's &quot;pdf-maker.r&quot;.  This
        script was created because images output by the original code39.r
        script would become blurred when inserted and resized by pdf-maker.r.
        Here, the bars are rendered as lines, directly in pdf-maker dialect.  The
        images generated are crisp and easily scannable.
