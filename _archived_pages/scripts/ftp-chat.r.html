excerpt: "
        A simple chat application that lets users send instant text messages
        back and forth across the Internet.
        The chat &quot;rooms&quot; are created by dynamically creating, reading, 
        appending, and saving text files via ftp (to use the program, you'll
        need access to an available ftp server: ftp address, username, and
        password).
