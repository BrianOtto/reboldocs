        A minimal example demonstrating how to use the captcha library by SOFTINNOV:
        http://softinnov.org/rebol/captcha.shtml

        NOTE:  the first part of this script CAN be used to create catchpa images
        in a non-graphic environment.  You can, for example, run the first 6 lines
        of this script on your web server - just be sure to use REBOL/command 
        (available for free in the REBOL SDK Beta at http://www.rebol.net/builds/#section-1 
        rebcmd or rebcmd.exe - demo license available in the MAC download).
