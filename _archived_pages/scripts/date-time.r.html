excerpt: "
		This script contains the Rebol implementation of some date and time functions provided in 
		the glibc library and the gnumeric (and therefore Microsoft Excel) software.
		While the use and handling of date and time data are in most cases straightforward 
		with Rebol, some of the advanced date and times functionalities found in glibc and 
		gnumeric are still missing in Rebol.
		This script is therefore an attempt to fill the gap.
