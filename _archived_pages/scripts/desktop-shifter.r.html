excerpt: "
      To change the desktop wallpaper at specified intervals.

      There's a modifiable default time that a wallpaper will stay before switching.
      Each wallpaper has separate settings for:
         *Stretched versus Centered
         *Solid color versus Top/Bottom Gradient versus Left/Right gradient background
         *The two colors that can be chosen
         *A box for the time the wallpaper stays up before shifting - it says &quot;Default&quot; if it's
            using the default setting
