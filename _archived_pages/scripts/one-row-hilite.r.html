title: "Text-Lists With One Row Hi-lite "
license: "none"
excerpt: "The script was written to illustrate how a single hi-lite bar can be used with a group of text-lists.  The single bar is used instead of the in-built hi-lite of the text-list style. In a group of the default text-lists, all occurrences of identical data are hi-lighted if any one of them is picked  - and so no uniform hi-lite bar can be presented.
    
    The iter co-ordinates of the picked item of the text-list locate the hi-lite bar.
