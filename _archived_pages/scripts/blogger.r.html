        This program allows users to create and add entries to an online blog page.
        The GUI has text fields which allow the user to enter a title, link, and blog text,
        as well as a button to select an image file which will be uploaded and included
        in the blog entry. When the &quot;Upload&quot; button is clicked, an HTML file is created
        and uploaded to the user's web server, along with the image. Be sure to edit
        the ftp-url and html-url variables to represent actual user account information.

        A line by line explanation of this code is available at http://re-bol.com
