excerpt: "This is a module for reading and taking apart a modified
    NACHA file used in the Remote Payment and Presentation System.      
    If those terms mean anything, this could be a useful module.            
    If those terms mean nothing, then at least this module could be an    
    example of a way to handle a text file of fixed-format records.
    In 25 words or less, a NACHA file is a file of fixed-format text
    records containing information about bank transfers.  The records
    are of several different types (headers, detail, trailers)
    differentiated by a code in the first character of each record."
