excerpt: " This script will parse robot.txt files and store
             a hash! of forbidden paths. This is very useful for
             webbots or spiders of any kind (at least if obeying
             robot exclusion standards is desirable).

             I looked at the ht://dig package (http://www.htdig.org/)
             script that does the same thing as this script to see if I
             had overlooked something, and thereby fixed a few bugs.
           "
