excerpt: "
        Check e-mail account for messages, then process for
        paging to a Digital PCS phone. The processing includes
        chopping message/sender lengths and url-encoding. My
        cellular company wanted an extra $3/month just to give me
        an e-mail address that does what this script does.  (Can
        you believe that?  $3!) My PCS provider is Cantel AT&T in
        Canada.  You'll need to modify the script to work with
        your PCS carrier if you're not on Cantel.
