excerpt: " A script to handle URLs as objects. Rebol's built-in 'decode-url function
             returns an object, but no methods to manipulate it. This script includes
             functions that make it possible to manipulate the URL as you please.

             CGI parameters are parsed into an alphabetized block for ease of comparison
             of URLs.
