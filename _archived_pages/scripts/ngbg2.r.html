license: "none"
excerpt: " Downloads all the &quot;Picture Of The Day&quot; images (current and past)
	from the National Geographic website and saves it to a location of your choice.
	Revisions: 
	Version 1.2.5 Checked to see if the large wallpaper exists and if not to use the smaller
		wall paper image.		
	Version 1.2.4 Changed from &quot;Viewing&quot; the POTD to &quot;Browsing&quot; the POTD which then
		allows the user to go back to see other pictures that may have been missed.
	Version 1.2.3 Added displays for current file name download. Added slider to set
		the number of downloads for this run.
	Version 1.2.2 Added a stop (abort) button.
	Version 1.2.1 I didn't like the silent operation so I added a progress meter.
	Version 1.2.0 Modified to download all past POD (pictures of the day) images starting
	from 2001-04-21 to current date. Also modified to store each POD with a unique
	filename and also download the description of the picture and save it as an HTML file
	with links to Next and Previous pictures. Updated the help files and their display
	using the Request/OK function instead of the dump to console.  Added a directory
	requester for storing of files so users don't have to modify the code.  Added a 
	preferences file for storing this information as well as the maximum number of
	pictures per day to download.

	This version still uses the original NG website as it still works okay.  I have
	been able to download all images from 2001-04-21 to today, 2006-06-09.
	It will only download images which exist on the server but don't exist on your
	local drive in the path specified.  I put a 100 at a time limiter on the program
	because it seems that National Geographic has processes in place to limit
	the number of downloads or connections (possibly Denial Of Service attack
	blockers), because it seemed to hang when trying to download all of them at once.
	I tried again a few hours later and was able to download another 100.
	
	Like the version 1.0.0 it will download the large backdrop but it now gets the
	description from the original photo of the day page.
	
	It will display the current picture of the day and wait for the window to close
	before downloading the rest of the images.
	
	Version 1.1.0 by Charles Mougel: Used a different URL
	
	Version 1.0.0 by Ian Munroe: Downloads a single picture of the day - must be run 
	everyday.

	The argument &quot;-p&quot; causes a &quot;print to console&quot;.
	These directions can be seen by adding a &quot;-h&quot; agrument."
