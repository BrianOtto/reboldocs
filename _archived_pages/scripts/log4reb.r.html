title: "Logging Framework For Rebol"
license: "none"
excerpt: "Logging within the context of program development constitutes inserting statements 
		into the program that provide some kind of output information that is useful to the developer. 
		Examples of logging are trace statements, dumping of structures and the familiar 'prin or 
		'print debug statements. log4reb offers a hierarchical way to insert logging statements within 
		a Rebol program. Multiple output formats and multiple levels of logging information are available.
		By using log4reb, the overhead of maintaining thousands of 'print statements is alleviated as 
		the logging may be controlled at runtime from configuration scripts. log4reb maintains the log 
		statements in the shipped code. By formalising the process of logging, some feel that one is 
		encouraged to use logging more and with higher degree of usefulness."
