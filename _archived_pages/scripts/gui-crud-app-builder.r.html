        CRUD is an acronym for &quot;Create Read Update and Delete&quot;. 
        Familiar types of apps such as contact managers, inventory systems,
        home video databases, etc., are examples of typical CRUD data storage
        applications.  This script is a simple CRUD app maker that allows you to
        instantly create CRUD apps which store, retrieve, sort, etc. records made
        of fields of data.  The generated application scripts can be customized
        however desired, by adding your own of code.
