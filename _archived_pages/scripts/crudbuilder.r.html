title: "CRUD Builder"
excerpt: "
        A simple GUI application builder.  For each unique application, just copy this
        script to a new file name, edit the 'filename used to store record data (replace 
        %mycruddatafile with a filename specific to each new app), and then edit the
        'widgets block.  Any field or area widgets assigned a label will automatically be
        included in the app (i.e., item, info, sku, and notes, in the demo app below).
        You can include any number of such widgets, and the app will automatically allow
        you to create, save, edit, retrieve and delete records containing all of the labeled
        field data.  Select existing records using the automatically updated text-list widget.
        Create, save, and delete records using the buttons, and/or by using shortcut
        keystrokes (save: CTRL+S, new record: CTRL-N, delete currently selected
        record: DELETE key).
