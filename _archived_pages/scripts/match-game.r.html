excerpt: "
        A configurable 'concentration' type matching game.

        Enter the number of rows and columns which you want to play.
        The total number of boxes must be even (to allow pair matching), 
        max 11x10. Graphic size is automatically adjusted to fit the screen.

        To play, click on any pair of boxes.  Remember the characters
        revealed, and match all the pairs in the fewest number of moves. 
        The game ends, and your score is displayed when you've matched all
        the pairs.
