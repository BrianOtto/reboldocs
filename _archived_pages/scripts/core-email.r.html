title: "Core Email"
excerpt: "
 
         A simple email program that can run in REBOL/Core - entirely
          at the command line (no VID GUI components or View graphics 
          are required).  You can store configuration information for as
          many email accounts as you'd like in the &quot;accounts&quot; block, and
          easily switch between them at any point in the program.
