excerpt: "
        Demonstrates how to transfer binary files between 2 computers
        connected by a TCP port.  This is a shortened version of the script 
        explained at http://www.rebol.net/cookbook/recipes/0058.html .

        There are 2 separate programs here - one to run as server, and another
        to run as client.  The script is configured to demonstrate on a single machine.
        To run it on two separate computers, change the IP address in the client
        script.
