title: "HTML Form Server"
excerpt: "
        Creates a web server which serves an HTML form, and then
        processes the data input by users.  This can be useful when tallying
        information from users on a Local Area Network.  The users can use
        any device (iPhone, Android, netbook, etc.) to enter information into
        a shared system, as long as the device has a basic web browser
        and Wifi (or other network) connectivity. 
        Just edit the HTML form example, and do what you want with the 'z
        variable returned by the user(s).
