license: "BSD"
excerpt: "
		This is the official MakeDoc document formatter that is used by
		REBOL Technologies for all documentation. It is the fastest and
		easiest way to create good looking documentation using any text
		editor (even ones that do not auto-wrap text). It creates titles,
		headings, contents, bullets, numbered lists, indented examples,
		note blocks, and more. For documentation, notes, and other info
		visit http://www.rebol.net/docs/makedoc.html
